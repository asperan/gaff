# Disclaimer

This project has been created to reserve the name on crates.io; I don't know when I'm going to start working on this project (or even if I'm going to start).

If you want to use this name, you can request it by opening an issue on [my repository for discussions and requests](https://github.com/asperan/discussions-and-requests).

**IMPORTANT**: opening the issue does not imply that I'll surely give up on the project name, it is just a "formal" and public request.

While this disclaimer is present, the probability that the published project just contains an hello world file is almost 100%.

# Gaff

Gaff allows users to apply git hooks with ease from an external repository.

The name is derived from the [fishing gaff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_gaff).
